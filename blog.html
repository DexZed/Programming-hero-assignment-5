        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>== is the loose equality operator, which compares two values after performing type conversion. === is the strict equality operator, which compares both value and type without performing any type conversion. </p>

        <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">What are closures in JavaScript?</div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>A closure is a function that remembers and can access its outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing. This allows the function to preserve variables from its surrounding context. Closures are useful for data encapsulation and creating function factories.</p>

        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>async and await are used to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript more easily, avoiding the use of explicit .then() and .catch() chains with promises.</p>

        <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">What are higher-order functions in JavaScript?</div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument, returns a function, or both. This allows functions to be used as first-class citizens in JavaScript. Examples include map, filter, and reduce.</p>

        <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">What is the event loop in JavaScript?</div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p> The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking, asynchronous operations by offloading tasks to the browser (or Node.js) and then waiting for the result. JavaScript is single-threaded, so the event loop manages the execution of tasks and callbacks from the call stack and the callback queue. It continuously checks the call stack, and if it's empty, it processes tasks from the callback queue.</p>
